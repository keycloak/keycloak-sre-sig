= 2nd Keycloak SRE SIG Meeting (14th October 2024)
:navtitle: 14th October 2024

The recording is available https://youtu.be/P1Ck1Wa9ufo[on YouTube].

== Meeting purpose
The desired outcome is to identify different approaches for load testing Keycloak with their individual strengths, and which tools to recommend to the broader Keycloak community.

== Topics and presenters

1. Current state of Keycloak benchmark (@ahus1 and @mhajas))
2. Keycloak with many (1M+) offline sessions using Azure Load Testing (@sschu)
3. Load testing using "f1" (golang based load testing library) and our rationale behind not using Keycloak benchmark (@dominikschlosser and Stefan Klein)

=== 1. Keycloak benchmark

* Official tool living under Keycloak organization - https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark[repository], https://www.keycloak.org/keycloak-benchmark/[documentation]
* Consists of 3 main parts - provisioning, dataset creation, load running
* Provisioning Keycloak with monitoring stack
  - Local Minikube setup with services
  - Single cluster and multi site setup with Openshift
  - Contains Grafana dashboards
* Dataset provider
  - Keycloak extension
  - Creates entities in Keycloak (realms, clients, users, roles, etc)
* Load running
  - Using Gatling
  - Local and distributed (from AWS EC2 instances) load running
  - Various scenarios + contains reusable steps for custom scenarios
* Extras
  - Automation using Github Actions
  - Repository contains result-data branch with perf results over longer period of time
  - Results in private Horreum instance - may be public in future

=== 2. Azure load running
* Running Keycloak SaaS at Bosch
* >70 Keycloak instances, ~2M monthly active users
* Problems
- Many offline sessions because of mobile apps
- Regular restarts because of growing offline sessions in memory and many GCs
- State transfer timeouts
* Testing
- Production like environment
- Azure load testing
- JMeter test for creating scenarios and upload jmx to Azure
- Charged by thread - could get really expensive
- Using Grafana dashboards for displaying Keycloak metrics
* Scenario
- Preload offline sessions
- Perform authentication code flow
- Refresh token requests
- Logout
* Lessons learned
- Starts failing with 3.5 millions of offline sessions in memory
- 18GB of memory is enough for 3M sessions
- State transfer timeout needs to be adjusted with so many sessions in memory
- Never got OOM exception - the system got slower because of many GCs and eventually killed by a liveness probe (async probes didn’t help, Java GC ratio didn’t help, using G1GC)
- Offline tokens store IDP token with consumes a lot of memory
- String deduplication saved memory (18GB -> 15GB)
- Offline sessions preloading would be nice as a feature of dataset provider for filling memory

=== 3. Load testing with F1
* Deployments they run
- Varying between 20 - 12 million users, 1000 requests per second
- A lot of custom extensions
- Running on Apache Cassandra
- Custom login flows
* Why not Keycloak Benchmark
- Lots of customizations, custom REST api and CLI tool written in Go (for example, custom endpoint for creating users that needs to be used)
- Don’t want a published URL - because they didn’t want to test infrastructure outside of Keycloak (load balancer, waf, …)
- Prefer Go to Scala
* F1
- Golang load running tool - repository
- More lightweight than Gatling/Keycloak benchmark (still enough functionality)
- Easily integrated with their CLI tool, basically reusing Go functions in scenarios
- Using distributed load running across more nodes
* Scenarios
- Creating/deleting users
- UI logins
- Refreshing a lot of tokens
* Simplistic reports
* Using Grafana dashboards
* Summary: Not replacement for KCB - less features but enough for them

== Outcomes

* Keycloak benchmark is missing docs on how to create custom scenarios
* Keycloak benchmark is missing docs on how to extend dataset provider with custom data
* How to tune G1GC to throw exception on OOM instead of having too much CPU time spent on GC
* Missing Keycloak configuration for state transfer timeout
